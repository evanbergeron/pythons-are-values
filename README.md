# Pythons are Values

Pythons are Values is a hypothesis - that every python program has an equivalent one-liner. This goal is accomplished in a number of horrible, horrible ways. More coming soon.

### Todo
- Conditionals
- Tail recursion optimization to fix while loop lambda
- Reverse level order expressionizing for nesting issues
- Namespaces
- Coroutines to generator comphrensions
- Metaclasses / default type constructors
